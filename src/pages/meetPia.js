            <p sx={{ fontSize: 16 }}>
              I have been dancing my heart a way since I was 2 years old, as I
              was very fortunate to have a mother who owned her own a dance
              school called the Dance Barn right here in Rozelle. Before the
              dance Barn closed in 2014 I had been assisting and teaching my own
              classes there for about 3 years.
            </p>
            <p sx={{ fontSize: 16 }}>
              I love to dance, it is how I express myself. So it makes me very
              happy that I am starting my own school. I have been teaching all
              styles of dance, acrobatics, gymnastics and circus for about 6
              years and I have loved every minute of it.
            </p>
            <p sx={{ fontSize: 16 }}>
              For the last 4 years I have been in early childhood education and
              care, working with 3 months to 6 year oldâ€™s. While I was there I
              obtained my personal training certificate and have been teaching
              Pilates and aerobics and personal training sessions to adults
              which has been a new challenge and fun.
            </p>
            <p sx={{ fontSize: 16 }}>
              I have now realized that dance and owning my own business is
              definitely what I am meant to do. I am very passionate about dance
              and fitness and making it challenging and fun for everyone. I
              think we can all have fun and grow as a person even if we are 3 or
              93 years old, we still deserve to love ourselves and find our own
              voice in this crowded world.
